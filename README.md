# Psychic-Game
A letter guess game that asks user to pick a letter. If the letter matches the random letter generated by the computer, the user wins and a new letter is generated! If the letter does not match, the user can try again up to 5 times. If the user cannot guess the correct letter in 5 tries, the user loses and a new letter is generated :(
